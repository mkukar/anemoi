# anemoi
Uses historical weather data to see how global warming is affecting your local area

Created for Go Hack hackathon https://gohack.devpost.com/

My first Go project!

## Usage
1. Build: `go build`
1. Run: `.\anemoi.exe` (or equivalent)
1. Follow the prompts to enter your local area based on region and station name

## Troubleshooting
- _The script does not display many results for my area?_ Try using a different station, as some only gather limited data or do not go as far back in time
- _My area is not listed?_ Please add it to nowdata.go "regionMap" using the forecast office 3-letter code found on this website https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate
